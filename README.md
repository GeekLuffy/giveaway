## How It Works

1. **Cloning the Realm:**
   - Summon the AniPlay realm to your local space:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/illuminati-Dev/GiveawayBot && cd AniPlay
     ```

2. **Magic Ingredients:**
   - Gather your Python 3 wand and MongoDB cauldron.
   - Brew the required potions with a simple incantation:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Chant with MongoDB:**
   - Whisper to your MongoDB deity, creating a sacred connection URI.
   - Update `config.py` with this divine URI to sync your bot with the celestial database.

4. **Summon the Bot:**
   - Ignite the Python cauldron to bring AniPlay to life:
     ```bash
     python3 -m AniPlay
     ```
